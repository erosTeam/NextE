# Product Bug / Feature Intake

Status: active intake from side conversations.

Purpose:

- Capture product-oriented bug reports, feature gaps, and eros_fe behavior notes without interrupting the main implementation thread.
- Keep entries visible to future agents during active-plan review, even after chat context compaction.
- This file is an intake queue, not an implementation claim and not acceptance evidence.

Operating rule:

- Do not treat an entry here as immediate authorization to interrupt an active lane.
- Main-thread scheduling should pull from this file when selecting the next user-visible feature or bug-fix lane.
- Prefer issues that improve core use flows over low-priority parity enhancements.
- Before implementation, verify the relevant eros_fe source behavior and current NextE code path.
- When an intake item is implemented/fixed and committed, update that item with `Status`,
  commit hash, implemented scope, contracts/device evidence, and remaining acceptance gaps.
- Valid status values for handled entries: `implemented`, `implemented / pending device acceptance`,
  `implemented / needs controller acceptance`, `accepted`, or `parked`.
- A small implementation commit does not need to update this file immediately, but once an intake item
  has a clear fixing commit on main, the next control-plane update must mark the item so it no longer
  reads as an unhandled queue item.
  Historical PASS logs do not imply current acceptance; use `implemented / pending device acceptance`
  until a current simulator/device/controller acceptance pass exists.
- Any new UI or feature lane must provide five-line grounding before product-code changes:
  1. Concrete eros_fe page/component/method path.
  2. Primary information and first-screen hierarchy.
  3. Primary and secondary actions with intended visual weight.
  4. This lane's usable loop and explicit non-scope.
  5. HarmonyOS / Next2V / HDS expression, such as segmented control, title-bar bottomBuilder,
     toolbar/menu, FAB, settings row, or list row pattern.
- If those five lines cannot be answered, do not write UI. Contracts, builds, and screenshots verify
  implementation risk; they do not replace source grounding.
- UI screenshot acceptance must inspect hierarchy, spacing, and action weight, not just that controls
  exist.

## Intake Items

### Reader Starts From Wrong Image When Opening Later Thumbnail Pages

Type: bug

Priority suggestion: P0/P1

Status: implemented / needs controller acceptance

Implementation:

- `91f1eb4 fix(reader): seed sparse thumbnail jumps` introduced the first sparse thumbnail-start fix:
  AllThumbnails passes loaded preview seeds and preview-page markers; Reader loads the target preview
  page before gap filling.
- `48f08d0 fix(reader): seed tapped thumbnail image page` extends that fix so the tapped `/s/...`
  image-page URL is passed explicitly, seeded into the target absolute Reader index, resolved first,
  and cached under that index.

Evidence:

- Deterministic contracts: `scripts/test_reader_seeded_thumbnail_start_contract.mjs`,
  `scripts/test_reader_target_preview_page_contract.mjs`,
  `scripts/test_reader_placeholder_gap_turn_contract.mjs`,
  `scripts/test_image_page_reader_seed_contract.mjs`.
- Follow-up reader contracts that protect the same startup/jump surface:
  `scripts/test_all_thumbnails_page_jump_contract.mjs`, `scripts/test_reader_jump_contract.mjs`,
  `scripts/test_reader_vertical_initial_index_contract.mjs`.
- Final Mate X7 emulator pass on `127.0.0.1:5555` with hdc outside the sandbox and official signed HAP:
  public gallery `https://e-hentai.org/g/3989982/16600a66e8/`, AllThumbnails visible `40..45`,
  tapped page `41`, Reader first screen `41 / 138`, right tap stayed in the correct later range
  (`43 / 138` under the current double-page step setting), left tap returned to `41 / 138`.
  Evidence directory: `/private/tmp/nexte_reader_thumbnail_seed_evidence/`, especially
  `final_allthumbs_40_45.json`, `final_reader_page41_initial.json`,
  `final_reader_after_right.json`, `final_reader_back_to_41.json`,
  `final_reader_back_to_41.jpeg`.

Remaining acceptance:

- Needs controller/user acceptance review of the current evidence; no further device acceptance is
  required unless this Reader/AllThumbnails path changes again.

Source:

- User-reported prior device testing.

Observed behavior:

- In a gallery with multiple thumbnail pages, opening an image from a later thumbnail page can start the Reader from earlier pages instead of the tapped image.

Expected behavior:

- Tapping a thumbnail on page 2/3/etc. should open Reader with that exact image as the first visible page.
- Adjacent previous/next navigation should use the correct global image order.

Why this is likely tricky:

- EH image URLs cannot be derived directly from the gallery URL.
- The expected request chain is:
  1. gallery / thumbnail page
  2. parse each thumbnail's `/s/...` image-page URL
  3. request the image page
  4. parse the real full image URL
- Jumping to a later image needs the target thumbnail page and global index, not only gid/token.

Likely failure mode:

- The all-thumbnails / thumbnail-page click path may pass only a local index or only gallery gid/token.
- Reader may then resolve from the first thumbnail page and start near the beginning.

Likely modules to inspect:

- `feature/gallery/src/main/ets/pages/GalleryAllThumbnailsPage.ets`
- `shared/src/main/ets/model/RouteParams.ets`
- `feature/reader/src/main/ets/`
- `shared/src/main/ets/parser/EhGalleryImageParser.ets`
- eros_fe reader / gallery image index logic.

Implementation direction to evaluate:

- Preserve each thumbnail item's global absolute index.
- Preserve or pass the parsed `/s/...` image-page URL as a seed when opening Reader.
- Reader startup should prefer the seed image-page URL for the selected index, parse it into the real full image URL, and cache it under that index.
- If no seed URL is available, Reader should first resolve the thumbnail page containing the target index, not default to the first thumbnail page.

Acceptance shape:

- Use a multi-page-thumbnail gallery.
- Navigate to thumbnail page 2/3 or later.
- Tap a middle thumbnail.
- Reader first screen shows the tapped image.
- Previous/next navigation lands on the correct neighboring global indices.

Notes:

- This is a higher-priority user-visible bug than QuickSearch-style parity enhancements.
- Do not implement from memory alone; re-check eros_fe's actual request/index/cache flow before changing NextE.

### Gallery Detail Page Lacks Pull-To-Refresh

Type: bug / UX gap

Priority suggestion: P1

Status: implemented / pending device acceptance

Implementation:

- `7bc3bde feat(gallery): refresh detail page` added detail-page refresh behavior.
- Scope: `GalleryDetailPage` now exposes the project refresh gesture/path, and
  `GalleryDetailViewModel` owns the reload path so refresh preserves the current gallery identity
  instead of navigating away or creating a second fetch mechanism.

Evidence:

- Deterministic contract: `scripts/test_gallery_detail_refresh_contract.mjs`.
- Implementation commit exists on repository history. Treat any historical smoke as supporting
  evidence only; this intake item still needs current device/controller acceptance before marking
  `accepted`.

Remaining acceptance:

- Current simulator/device detail-page pull-to-refresh pass, including successful refresh and
  recoverable failed-refresh behavior where possible.

Source:

- User-reported current behavior.

Observed behavior:

- Gallery detail pages do not support pull-to-refresh.

Expected behavior:

- A user should be able to pull down on a gallery detail page to refresh the current gallery detail data.
- Refresh should preserve the current gallery identity and remain on the same detail page.

Why this matters:

- Detail pages can contain dynamic or auth-sensitive data such as favorite state, tags, comments summary, image counts, and availability/error state.
- Without refresh, users must leave and reopen the detail page to retry or update data.

Likely modules to inspect:

- `feature/gallery/src/main/ets/pages/GalleryDetailPage.ets`
- `feature/gallery/src/main/ets/viewmodel/GalleryDetailViewModel.ets`
- existing shared pull-refresh components in `shared/src/main/ets/components/`
- eros_fe gallery detail refresh behavior.

Implementation direction to evaluate:

- Add a detail-page refresh gesture using the project's existing pull-refresh scaffold/component pattern.
- Route refresh into the existing detail ViewModel reload path instead of creating a second fetch path.
- Keep current navigation state, gallery params, safe-area behavior, and scroll position rules intentional.
- Ensure loading/error UI does not blank already loaded detail content unless the current project pattern requires it.

Acceptance shape:

- Open a gallery detail page.
- Pull down to refresh.
- The current detail page reloads successfully without navigating away.
- On a failed refresh, the existing detail content should remain usable where possible and show a recoverable error state.

### Very Tall Gallery Covers Break List Row Height

Type: bug

Priority suggestion: P0/P1

Status: implemented / pending device acceptance

Implementation:

- `14d471c fix(gallery): bound list cover row height` clamps list cover row height behavior for
  extreme tall/narrow covers.
- Scope: `GalleryCard` applies explicit list-cover sizing constraints so extreme cover ratios cannot
  force fixed-height list rows to become unboundedly tall.

Evidence:

- Deterministic contracts: `scripts/test_cover_presentation_contract.mjs`,
  `scripts/test_list_height_mode_contract.mjs`, `scripts/test_list_responsive_cover_contract.mjs`.
- Historical Mate X7 evidence exists for Home fixed/adaptive list modes, but active visual acceptance
  is not automatically closed by history.

Remaining acceptance:

- Current targeted device/controller acceptance with an extreme tall/narrow cover fixture or real
  gallery in fixed and adaptive modes.

Source:

- User-reported current behavior.

Observed behavior:

- Gallery list rows can still become very tall even when fixed list height is selected.
- Some Korean webtoon-style galleries have extremely tall/narrow covers.
- The list cover respects the raw cover ratio too much, so the cover height stretches and pushes the whole row much taller than intended.

Expected behavior:

- Fixed-height list mode must keep rows fixed even for extreme cover ratios.
- Adaptive/non-fixed list mode may grow for tags/content, but it still needs a maximum supported cover aspect ratio.
- When a cover is taller than that allowed ratio, NextE should handle it deliberately instead of stretching the row indefinitely.

Why this matters:

- A single extreme cover can destroy scan density and make the list feel broken.
- The fixed-height setting currently appears unreliable to users if cover ratio can override it.
- This affects a high-frequency browsing surface, not a low-priority visual edge case.

Likely failure mode:

- `EhThumbnail` / `GalleryCard` may use source cover ratio or `aspectRatio` in a way that can exceed the intended row height.
- Fixed-height row constraints may not prevent a child image from requesting a taller layout.
- Adaptive mode may have no maximum cover-ratio clamp.

Likely modules to inspect:

- `shared/src/main/ets/components/GalleryCard.ets`
- `shared/src/main/ets/components/EhThumbnail.ets`
- `shared/src/main/ets/state/ListModeState.ets`
- `scripts/test_list_height_mode_contract.mjs`
- `scripts/test_list_responsive_cover_contract.mjs`
- eros_fe list item cover sizing and maximum ratio handling.

Implementation direction to evaluate:

- Define an explicit maximum list-cover height / aspect-ratio policy for both fixed and adaptive modes.
- Fixed mode should ensure the cover cannot expand the row beyond the fixed row height.
- Adaptive mode should still clamp extreme cover ratios so very tall/narrow covers do not dominate the list.
- The fix should not be a one-off `maxWidth` patch; it should be based on row/container sizing and cover-ratio policy.
- Preserve normal cover containment/cropping behavior for ordinary manga/doujin covers.

Acceptance shape:

- Use or fixture a gallery list item with an extreme tall/narrow cover ratio.
- In fixed-height mode, the row remains fixed height and the cover is handled within the allowed slot.
- In adaptive mode, the row may adapt for content but does not stretch indefinitely because of the cover ratio alone.
- Ordinary cover ratios still render as before.

### Gallery Detail Tags Do Not Jump To Search

Type: feature gap / UX gap

Priority suggestion: P1

Status: implemented / pending device acceptance

Implementation:

- `45bc895 feat(gallery): search from detail tags` wires gallery detail tags into the shared Search
  route/action path.
- Scope: `GalleryTagsCard` tag taps dispatch through the existing shared search/navigation path
  rather than adding a separate detail-only search implementation.

Evidence:

- Deterministic contract: `scripts/test_tag_chip_contract.mjs`.
- Implementation commit exists on repository history. Treat historical device evidence as supporting
  context only until current acceptance is recorded.

Remaining acceptance:

- Current simulator/device pass: tap a namespaced detail tag, verify Search opens with the correct
  query and results load, then return to detail normally.

Source:

- User-reported missing behavior.

Observed behavior:

- Tapping a tag on the gallery detail page does not appear to jump to a search for that tag.

Expected behavior:

- Tapping a detail tag should open the shared Search page with an appropriate tag query seeded and executed.
- Namespace-aware tags should preserve the correct EH search syntax.

Why this matters:

- Tag-to-search is a high-frequency discovery path in EH-style browsing.
- Without it, users cannot naturally pivot from a gallery detail page to related galleries by tag.

Likely modules to inspect:

- `feature/gallery/src/main/ets/components/GalleryTagsCard.ets`
- `feature/gallery/src/main/ets/pages/GalleryDetailPage.ets`
- `shared/src/main/ets/state/SearchActionState.ets`
- `feature/search/src/main/ets/pages/GallerySearchPage.ets`
- eros_fe detail tag tap / search query formatting behavior.

Implementation direction to evaluate:

- Wire detail tag tap into the existing shared search action bus rather than creating a second search route.
- Preserve namespace-qualified query formatting based on eros_fe behavior.
- Push or focus the shared Search page in normal gallery scope, not favorite scope.
- Keep My Tags / usertag color display behavior separate from navigation behavior.

Acceptance shape:

- Open a gallery detail page with namespaced tags.
- Tap a tag.
- Search page opens with the correct query visible in the title-bar field.
- Results load for that tag query.
- Returning to the detail page should keep normal navigation behavior.

### Reader Loading State Is Unstable And Lacks Image Download Progress

Type: bug / reading UX gap

Priority suggestion: P0/P1

Status: implemented / needs controller acceptance

Implementation:

- `0bf9744 fix(reader): center staged loading` replaces loose Reader loading spinners with a
  dedicated centered line-loading overlay.
- Scope: Reader first-entry / jump resolving uses `reader_loading_resolving`; horizontal and vertical
  image pages show `reader_loading_image` after a real image URL is known and keep it visible until
  `Image.onComplete`.
- The implementation preserves the existing resolver, navigation, zoom, retry, and re-source paths.
- It does not fake byte percentages because the current ArkUI `Image` path in NextE does not expose a
  reliable byte-progress signal in this lane.

Evidence:

- Deterministic contract: `scripts/test_reader_loading_progress_contract.mjs`.
- Regression contracts run in the fixing lane: `scripts/test_reader_auto_source_retry_contract.mjs`,
  `scripts/test_reader_seeded_thumbnail_start_contract.mjs`,
  `scripts/test_reader_placeholder_gap_turn_contract.mjs`,
  `scripts/test_reader_precache_contract.mjs`, `scripts/test_reader_double_page_contract.mjs`,
  `scripts/test_reader_current_image_share_contract.mjs`, `scripts/test_reader_jump_contract.mjs`.
- Gates: i18n duplicate check, V1 decorator inventory, `git diff --check`, official signed Hvigor
  build.
- Mate X7 emulator target `127.0.0.1:5555`, hdc outside sandbox, official signed HAP installed:
  opened Reader from a public 26P gallery and jumped to page 25; Reader rendered normally with no
  black-screen/dead-loading failure.
  Evidence directory: `/private/tmp/nexte_reader_loading_progress_evidence/`, especially
  `reader_initial.png`, `reader_initial_layout.json`, `reader_jump_loading.png`,
  `reader_jump_loading_layout.json`.

Remaining acceptance:

- Needs controller/user acceptance of the loading-stage screenshot behavior. The emulator network was
  fast enough that the captured screenshots landed after images had loaded, so transient loading UI is
  primarily protected by contract/build evidence until a slow-network/manual capture is available.
- True determinate byte percentage remains future work unless Reader image loading moves to a path that
  exposes supported byte progress.

Source:

- User-reported current behavior.

Observed behavior:

- On first entering Reader, the loading indicator can appear at the bottom first, then jump to the center.
- Reader loading is not visually split into the two real stages:
  1. HTML / image-page URL resolution, including possible target thumbnail-page parsing after a jump.
  2. Full image network loading after the actual image URL is known.
- During the second stage, NextE can show a plain black screen or only an undifferentiated spinner,
  with no visible image download progress.

Expected behavior:

- Initial Reader loading indicator should be stably centered from first paint.
- Stage 1 should communicate that the app is resolving/parsing the target image page, not downloading
  the full image yet.
- Stage 2 should display image download progress once the full image URL is available.
- The image loading phase should not look like a dead black screen.

eros_fe behavior:

- `ImageExt` uses `ExtendedImage.network(... handleLoadingProgress: true ...)`.
- In `LoadState.loading`, `eros_fe` reads `ImageChunkEvent` and computes progress as
  `cumulativeBytesLoaded / expectedTotalBytes`.
- `_ViewLoading` delegates to `_ViewLoadingLine`, a centered horizontal progress bar with optional
  percentage text.
- This is simple and direct: once the real image URL is being loaded, users can see progress.

Likely NextE gap:

- `ReaderViewModel` and `ReaderImagePage` already separate URL resolving (`ImageResolveService.resolve`)
  from image rendering, but the UI only exposed a generic `LoadingProgress`.
- ArkUI `Image` completion/error callbacks are used, but no image load-progress UI was surfaced in
  `ReaderImagePage` before `0bf9744`.
- The root `Stack({ alignContent: Alignment.Bottom })` contributed to loose loading indicators appearing
  at the bottom before centered content appeared.

Acceptance shape:

- First Reader entry shows a stable centered loading state; no bottom-to-center jump.
- A deep jump that requires thumbnail-page/image-page parsing clearly shows a resolving stage.
- Once image URL loading begins, loading progress is visible when supported; until then, a centered
  image-loading line is visible instead of a dead black screen.
- Existing Reader navigation, zoom, retry, and re-source behavior remain intact.
